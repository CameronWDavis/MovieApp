# Purple Movie Watch Application

The Purple Movie Watch application is a React-based web application designed to enhance the movie-watching experience by allowing users to search for movies, maintain a list of watched movies, and rate them. This project showcases the effective use of Component Composition to build a dynamic and user-friendly interface while addressing common challenges such as prop drilling.

## Key Features

- **Movie Search**: Users can search for movies using the OMDB API, which provides a vast database of movie information.
- **Dynamic Movie Lists**: The application supports adding movies to a watched list, where users can also manage their selections.
- **Star Rating System**: A custom-built star rating component allows users to rate movies, enhancing the interactivity and personalization of the application.
- **Component Composition**: Through Component Composition, the app dynamically renders UI components based on user interactions, improving the appâ€™s scalability and maintainability.
- **Error Handling**: Integrated error handling provides user feedback on unsuccessful operations, such as failed API calls or searches yielding no results.
- **Abortable Fetch Requests**: Implements abortable fetch requests to prevent memory leaks and ensure that the application's performance is optimized.

## Accomplishments

- **Advanced Component Composition**: Mastered the utilization of Component Composition to construct more dynamic components and effectively handle prop drilling. This approach has significantly enhanced the flexibility and reusability of the application's UI components.

- **Star Rating Component Development**: Developed a bespoke star rating component that not only allows users to rate movies but also supports component testing to validate its functionality. Furthermore, an API was created for this component, providing flexibility for replacing or customizing the component as needed.

- **Robust API Integration**: Successfully integrated with the OMDB API to fetch a vast array of movie information, demonstrating proficiency in working with external APIs.

- **Custom Error Handling and User Feedback Mechanisms**: Implemented a comprehensive error handling strategy to manage and respond to errors gracefully during API calls and other asynchronous operations.

- **Performance Optimization**: Applied best practices in web development to optimize the application's performance, including abortable fetch requests to prevent memory leaks and unnecessary processing.

- **Accessibility and User Experience Design**: Prioritized accessibility and user experience in the design and development of the application.

- **Responsive Design**: Developed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the application delivers a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Security Considerations**: Implemented security best practices to protect sensitive data, such as API keys and user information.
